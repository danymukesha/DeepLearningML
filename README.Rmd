# DeepLearningML

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`DeepLearningML` is an R package that facilitates deep learning 
and machine learning modeling for metabolomics data analysis. 
The package provides a comprehensive set of tools to train, evaluate, 
and assess the feature importance of deep learning models 
and other machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- Train deep learning models using `h2o`.
- Implement various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (RPART), and others using the `caret` package.
- Perform model evaluation using ROC and AUC analysis.
- Estimate feature importance from trained models.
